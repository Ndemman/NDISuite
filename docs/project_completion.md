# NDISuite Report Generator - Project Completion Report

## Project Overview

The NDISuite Report Generator is a comprehensive AI-powered application designed to streamline the process of creating NDIS (National Disability Insurance Scheme) reports. The application integrates advanced technologies including real-time audio transcription, document processing, and AI-assisted content generation to help healthcare professionals create high-quality reports efficiently.

   - JWT-based authentication
   - Secure password reset flow

2. **Data Models**
   - Session and Report models for organizing content
   - Template system for report structure
   - Versioning for report changes

3. **Transcription Service**
   - Real-time WebSocket-based audio processing
   - Integration with OpenAI's Whisper API
   - Segment-based transcript storage

4. **Document Processing**
   - Support for PDF, DOCX, and TXT files
   - Text extraction and chunking
   - Storage management for uploaded files

5. **AI-Powered Content Generation**
   - LangChain integration for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
   - OpenAI GPT models for content creation
   - Context-aware content refinement

6. **Asynchronous Task Processing**

   - Document upload with drag-and-drop
   - Manual entry options

5. **Report Builder**
   - Template-based structure
   - AI-assisted content generation
   - Real-time editing and formatting

6. **Preview and Export**
   - WYSIWYG preview
   - Multiple export formats (PDF, DOCX)
   - Sharing options

### Integration and Testing

We have ensured quality and reliability through:
