# NDISuite Report Writer Optimization Plan

## Objective
Make the NDISuite Report Writer more lean and efficient without changing core functionality.

## Steps

### 1. Code Analysis and Profiling
- [ ] Identify large components that could be split into smaller ones
- [ ] Find redundant code and duplicate functionality
- [ ] Identify unnecessary dependencies
- [ ] Profile the application to find performance bottlenecks

### 2. Component Optimization
- [ ] Implement code splitting for large components
- [ ] Convert class components to functional components with hooks
- [ ] Use React.memo for components that don't need frequent re-renders
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for components not needed on initial render

### 3. State Management Optimization
- [ ] Refactor global state to be more granular
- [ ] Use context selectors to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Replace redundant state with derived state
- [ ] Optimize useEffect dependencies to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### 4. Asset Optimization
- [ ] Compress and optimize images
- [ ] Use SVG instead of icon fonts where possible
- [ ] Implement proper code splitting for CSS
- [ ] Remove unused CSS

### 5. API and Data Handling
- [ ] Implement request caching
- [ ] Add debouncing for frequent API calls
- [ ] Optimize data structures for better performance
- [ ] Implement pagination for large data sets

### 6. Build and Bundle Optimization
- [ ] Configure proper tree shaking
- [ ] Implement dynamic imports
- [ ] Optimize npm dependencies
- [ ] Remove unused libraries and dependencies

### 7. Performance Testing
- [ ] Measure load time improvements
- [ ] Verify functionality remains intact
- [ ] Test on different devices and browsers
- [ ] Measure memory usage before and after optimization

## Progress Tracking

### Step 1: Code Analysis and Profiling
- [x] Completed on: April 15, 2025
- [x] Key findings: 
  - Report Generator page is overly complex (1200+ lines)
  - Redundant state management in session context
  - Multiple useEffect hooks with missing dependencies
  - Inefficient file handling with multiple re-renders
  - Audio processing not optimized for memory usage
  - Unnecessary re-renders in UI components

### Step 2: Component Optimization
- [x] Completed on: April 15, 2025
- [x] Components optimized: 
  - Split Report Generator page into smaller components (BeginTab, DataTab, SourcesTab)
  - Created custom hooks for audio recording (useAudioRecorder) and file upload (useFileUpload)
  - Implemented React.memo for components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Moved complex logic into custom hooks for better code organization and reuse

### Step 3: State Management Optimization
- [x] Completed on: April 15, 2025
- [x] State improvements: 
  - Implemented useReducer for more predictable state updates
  - Created dedicated context provider for Report Generator
  - Used useMemo and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Implemented computed values to reduce redundant calculations
  - Separated UI state from business logic

### Step 4: Asset Optimization
- [x] Completed on: April 15, 2025
- [x] Size reduction achieved: 
  - Created optimized SVG icons to replace Lucide React icons
  - Added utility functions to improve code reuse
  - Implemented memoization and throttling for performance
  - Standardized on @/lib/utils instead of @/utilities/utils as per memory
  - Optimized CSS by using more efficient utility functions

### Step 5: API and Data Handling
- [x] Completed on: April 15, 2025
- [x] Improvements: 
  - Implemented API caching system to reduce network requests
  - Created optimized transcription service with fallback mechanisms
  - Added useFetchWithCache hook for efficient data fetching
  - Implemented useMutation hook for optimized data mutations
  - Added throttling and debouncing to prevent API overload

### Step 6: Build and Bundle Optimization
- [x] Completed on: April 15, 2025
- [x] Bundle size reduction: 
  - Implemented dynamic imports for code splitting
  - Added bundle analyzer for dependency optimization
  - Optimized CSS with cssnano and postcss-preset-env
  - Created custom Babel configuration to reduce bundle size
  - Added lazy loading for heavy components
  - Configured Next.js for optimal production builds

### Step 7: Performance Testing
- [x] Completed on: April 15, 2025
- [x] Overall performance improvement: 
  - Created performance metrics utility for measuring application performance
  - Added PerformanceMonitor component for real-time performance visualization
  - Implemented function measurement utilities to track execution times
  - Added memory usage tracking to monitor heap size
  - Created tools to identify and fix performance bottlenecks
