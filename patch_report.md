# CSRF Fix Implementation Report

## Changes Implemented

I've successfully updated the authentication service with the requested CSRF protection improvements:

1. **Added the `getCookie` Helper Function**
   - Added at the top of `frontend/src/api/authService.ts`
   - Provides a more robust way to extract cookies using proper regex pattern
   - Includes decodeURIComponent for cookie value safety

2. **Updated the Login Method**
   - Replaced the manual cookie extraction code with the new `getCookie` helper
   - Kept the credentials and CSRF token header handling that was already in place
   - Maintained the same structure for the fetch request

### Before and After Comparison

**Before (manual cookie extraction):**
```typescript
// Read the CSRF token from cookies
const match = document.cookie.match(/csrftoken=([^;]+)/);
const csrfToken = match ? match[1] : '';
console.log('CSRF Token retrieved:', csrfToken ? 'Yes' : 'No');
```

**After (using getCookie helper):**
```typescript
// Get CSRF token using the helper function
const csrfToken = getCookie('csrftoken') || '';
console.log('CSRF Token retrieved:', csrfToken ? 'Yes' : 'No');
```

## Technical Analysis

The implementation makes several improvements to the CSRF handling:

1. **More Robust Cookie Extraction**
   - The new RegExp approach in `getCookie` properly handles cookie boundaries
   - It works regardless of the cookie's position in the cookie string
   - Adds URI decoding to handle special characters in cookie values

2. **Better Reusability**
   - The `getCookie` function can now be used for other cookies beyond CSRF
   - Follows a common pattern used in many web applications

3. **Consistency with Django's Expected Pattern**
   - Properly extracts the Django-generated 'csrftoken' cookie
   - Follows Django's expected CSRF flow (get cookie â†’ include in header)

## Note on Existing Issues

I noticed the TypeScript linter is still showing an error about the UUID module:
```
Cannot find module 'uuid' or its corresponding type declarations. (severity: error)
```

This appears to be the same issue mentioned in previous sessions. It's not directly related to the CSRF implementation and would need to be addressed separately, possibly by ensuring the `@types/uuid` package is installed.

## Next Steps

As directed in the instructions, the next steps are:

1. Rebuild the frontend Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker compose build frontend
   ```

2. Restart the container:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d frontend
   ```

3. Test the login flow by:
   - Hard-refreshing the login page (Ctrl+F5)
   - Attempting to log in with test credentials

This improved CSRF implementation, combined with the earlier fixes (API_URL in Docker Compose, Django ALLOWED_HOSTS update, and Next.js rewrites configuration), should enable a fully functional authentication flow between the frontend and backend containers.
