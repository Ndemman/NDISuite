# Frontend UI Remodeling Plan

This document outlines the plan for remodeling the frontend UI to provide better spacing, organization, and visual hierarchy.

## [x] 1. Analysis of Current UI

- [x] Identify the active layout components
  - Current implementation uses `components/ui/sidebar.tsx` and `components/layout/AppLayout.tsx`
- [x] Analyze current spacing and scale issues
  - UI is currently too condensed, needs 20% zoom out
  - Items need more spacing between them
- [x] Examine navigation structure
  - Settings is currently in the footer but needs Profile nearby
  - Coming Soon items need to be organized better

- [x] Increase spacing between elements
  - ✓ Added more padding between sidebar items (px-4 py-2.5 my-1)
  - ✓ Increased margins in content areas (p-8 instead of p-6)
  - ✓ Added more space between elements in dashboard grid
